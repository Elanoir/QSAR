# QSAR
The QSAR (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) Biodegradation dataset contains 41 molecular descriptors used to classify 1055 chemicals into 2 classes: ready and not ready biodegradable.

Aim: Best possible classification models to Classify Biodegradable variable;
Models should examine different hyperparameters and select the best one;
Simple Cross Validation (testing=25% of all data) for evaluating the models.
Objectives: Produce the best Classification model and identify the most significant features.
